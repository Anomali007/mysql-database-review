MySQL Database Review

npm install
npm start

start mysql server + mysql shell

### Exercise 1

In your database folder, create an index file.
In your shell, create a mysql database.
Set up Sequelize to establish a connection to the mysql database, and export the connection.

### Exercise 2

Create a file to describe our Sequelize model schema.
Export your schema.

### Exercise 3

Connect your database to your server. Build out your controller functionality in the server controller file.

### Exercise 4

Create a file with some data that fits your schema, and write a function to seed that data into the database. Add this functionality as a setup script to your package.json and run it.

### Exercise 5

Use an external tool such as Postman to test your database with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests. Check that the database is being updated with each request in your mysql shell.
